1. **Implement Trading Interface** - Complete buy/sell functionality in frontend
2. **Market Explorer Page** - Allow users to search and view stocks/crypto
3. **Leaderboard System** - Implement ranking calculation and display
4. **Achievement System** - Auto-award achievements based on criteria

### Medium Priority
5. **Performance Charts** - Add Recharts visualizations
6. **Background Jobs** - Set up cron jobs for data updates
7. **Challenges System** - Complete challenge join/track functionality
8. **Testing Suite** - Add critical path tests

### Low Priority
9. **Advanced Features** - WebSocket, alerts, watchlists
10. **Social Features** - User interactions, following
11. **Analytics** - Advanced reports and insights

## üîß Technical Debt

- [ ] Add comprehensive error messages for better debugging

## üìä Code Coverage Goals

- Backend Services: 0% ‚Üí Target 80%
- Frontend Components: 0% ‚Üí Target 70%
- API Endpoints: 0% ‚Üí Target 85%

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database Schema | ‚úÖ Ready | All tables created and seeded |
| Backend API | ‚úÖ Ready | Core endpoints functional |
| Frontend App | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic pages complete, needs features |
